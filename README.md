## konaha-gram
*konaha-gram* a single page application I made, in attempt to revise the   integratation of  Redux with React. I'm not going to say it's an _instagram clone_, but ya know. The finished product can be viewed at online at https://konaha-gram.netlify.app/.

## Using the app

You can use this app just like you would any photo-viewing app. Upon load, you'll be greeted with a bunch of random photos with some captions, likes, and comments. You can scroll through and click on any photo you like to see more details.

Upon click, you'll be routed to the detailed photo view, where the picture will be enlarged, alone with the option to _add_ or _delete_ any comments there. You can also like the photos from either view, at any time.If you click on the logo, you'll be taken back to the base page, where your changes will still be saved, until page reload!
